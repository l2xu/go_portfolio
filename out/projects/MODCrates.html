                    <div class="project_description">MODCrates is a imagined product that was created for the project management module in the 4th semester. The idea behind the product is a variety of modular kitchen units that can be put together as needed. Furthermore, the kitchen modules are able to keep track of the grocceries inside of them and can provide valuable information and recepies based on them. The goal of this project was to train our skills on the things we’ve learned in the previous semesters and to work and coordinate ourself in a project for a whole semester. My role was the “Project Leader”, so I had to keep track of all the task we had to do, assaing them and make sure we’re on schedule. To deal with this I used Notion as a project management tool to keep track of everyting. We used a Kanban board to manage the task and had serveral ressoruce pages where we stored valuable information for the project. Besides the task as a project leader I also worked on the UI design for the website and the app of the product. Here we used Figma as a protoyping tool.</div>
