                    <div class="project_description">This project was part of the 4th semester at HS-Harz, and the task was to create an android app using Java and Android Studio. I decided to build a fictional pizza app where users can create and customize their own pizzas and order them afterwards. The app allows users to select the type of crust, sauce, and toppings for their pizza, and it calculates the total price based on their choices. The pizza can also be saved and stored in a database (SQLite), so it can be ordered again at a later time. Working on this project was a great opportunity for me to improve and practice my skills in Java and general programming. I learned how to use Android Studio and build a user-friendly and functional app that is easy to use. I also gained experience with database design and implementation, which is an important skill for any software developer. Overall, I am proud of the work I did on this project and the positive feedback I received from my classmates and instructors. It was a great learning experience for me, and I am excited to continue developing my skills and working on similar projects in the future.</div>
