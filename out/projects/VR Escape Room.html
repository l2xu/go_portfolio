                    <div class="project_description">The VR game &#39;Escape The Pyramid&#39; was created as a group project in the 5th semester, and it was my first experience with VR game development. We used Unity and the OpenXR Toolkit to build the game, which allowed us to create a visually stunning and immersive VR experience. The goal of the game is to escape a pyramid by solving three different riddles. The riddles are challenging but not impossible, and they are designed to test the player&#39;s logic and problem-solving skills. The game has a low poly style, which gives it a unique and distinctive look and feel. Working on this project was a great opportunity for me to learn more about VR game development and apply my knowledge of Unity and C# to a real-world project. I was able to improve my skills in game design, programming, and teamwork, and I gained valuable experience working on a complex and challenging project. Overall, I am proud of the work I did on this project and the positive feedback I received from my classmates and instructors. It was a great learning experience for me, and I am excited to continue developing my skills and working on similar projects in the future.</div>
