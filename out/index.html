                <h1>Lukas Weihrauch</h1>
                <p>Hi, I’m Lukas and I’m the guy with the big picture in mind. My interest and skills are very wide
                    spread and therefore I’m very good at connecting things and put them all together to make awesome
                    stuff!</p>
                <p>

                    I’m studying media and computer science @hs-harz in Germany. In march 2021 I founded my own Company
                    “Pixelloop Studio” where I started to use the knowledge from my studies to build websites for small
                    businesses. Currently, I’m working on a media brand called “Moving Millennial”.

                </p>
                <p>
                    As you might guess, I love doing and creating things. I live by the philosophy, that action does not
                    always bring happiness, but there is no happiness without action.
                </p>
